Instructions for updating App.tsx:

1. Add these imports at the top:
```jsx
import FlowBuilder from './pages/FlowBuilder';
import Analytics from './pages/Analytics';
import Templates from './pages/Templates';
```

2. Add these routes within the protected app routes section:
```jsx
<Route path="/flow-builder" element={<FlowBuilder />} />
<Route path="/flow-builder/:id" element={<FlowBuilder />} />
<Route path="/analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
<Route path="/templates" element={<Templates />} />
```

3. The routing for these pages should be added right after the main app pages (Dashboard, Contacts, Campaigns) and before the Billing routes.
